# React Redux Todo App

This is a simple todo list app built using React, Redux, and React Router. It is an implementation of the todo app from the [Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/basics) that has been expanded in several ways including improved routing, state persistence, the ability to start over, and better styling.
