# Redux-Test

This is a simple todo list app built using React and Redux. It is largely the same as the todo app presented in the [Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/basics), but it has a few very minor changes and some additional notes.

## Useage

To run the todo app locally, just clone the repo and then run:
```
npm install
```
The project can be viewed on a development server at localhost:3000 by running:
```
npm start
```
